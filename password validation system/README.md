# Password Validator Program

This Python program checks if a user-provided password meets specific security requirements.

## Description

The `a_password_validation_system_program_using_python.py` script prompts the user to enter a password and then validates it against the following criteria:

*   At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
*   At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
*   At least one digit (0-9)
*   At least one special character (!@#$%&*)
*   Password length between 6 and 20 characters (inclusive)

The program uses regular expressions to perform the validation.  If the password is valid, a success message is printed. Otherwise, an error message is displayed, explaining the password requirements.
