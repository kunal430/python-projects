# Password Generator

This Python project generates random passwords of a specified length, ensuring a mix of lowercase, uppercase, digits, and symbols for increased security.

## Description

The `password_generator.py` script provides a command-line interface for creating strong passwords.  It prompts the user for the desired password length and then generates a random password that includes at least one character from each of the following sets:

* Lowercase letters (a-z)
* Uppercase letters (A-Z)
* Digits (0-9)
* Symbols (punctuation characters)

The generated password is then printed to the console.
